  Is a visual artist, born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she lives and works. Her artistic production seeks crossings between art, literature and environmental context. It thematizes existential issues, the cycle of life, perenniality and ephemerality, loss and resilience. In her most recent works, Lyrio focuses on the development of fictional narratives on large canvases in which the materiality of the word plays a leading role in the visual body. The artist emphasizes gesture and process, visibility and invisibility, legibility and illegibility, while seeking to relate handwritten writing and the drawing of nature in the construction of a possible landscape. Cláudia develops works of painting, engraving, installations, objects and artist's books. She held the solo shows The Melancholic Naturalist, Caixa Cultural Rio/RJ (2023-24); and Redesigning the Landscape, Blumenau Museum of Art/SC.
