  My artistic practice is rooted in conceptual expression—spanning performance, ready-made, sculpture, text-based work, assemblage, and installation. With a critical eye on authority, tradition, and the consequences of collective choices, I create work that confronts socio-political issues. Satire often plays a central role, serving as both a critical and therapeutic tool. As a refugee during the 1990s and later an immigrant, my work navigates themes of identity, equality, freedom of expression, and the erosion of civic dialogue. I aim to challenge, provoke, and invite reflection.

  Recent exhibitions include Being Political (CZKD, Belgrade, 2025), Matrix-Ost (Museum Kesselhaus Herzberge, Berlin, 2025), Presence / Absence and the Hidden Third (Art Project Space, Athens, 2025), and Human Capital (Contemporary Calgary & Confederation Centre of the Arts, 2024). Participated in the 60th Venice Biennale (Croatian Pavilion, 2024) in Vlatka Horvat’s project By the Means at Hand, curated by Antonia Majaca. Finalist for the inaugural Borka Pavićević award for the solo exhibition I Like When You Feel Uncomfortable (2024). Other notable presentations include Festival KROKODIL (2023), Feminist Duration Reading Group (Cell Project Space, London, 2023), Milky Way (MoCA Vojvodina, 2023), Northeast Southwest (Kunsthaus Dresden, 2022), and several solo and group exhibitions in Belgrade. Artist-in-residence at CAAF (Canada), AGA LAB (Netherlands), Konstepidemin (Sweden), NES (Iceland), and Institut für Alles Mögliche (Germany), among others.
