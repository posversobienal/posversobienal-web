  ## MAIL ART POETRY - POETRY IS RESISTANCE COLLATERAL PROJECT CURATED BY RUGGERO MAGGI {id="mail_art_poetry"}


  "In the scenario of the dystopian landscapes of our contemporary society, thinking of poetry no longer as a simple aesthetic exercise, but as a critical and political tool implies approaching the experimental in a situated and contextual dimension. In this sense, the POSVERSO Biennial is conceived as an appeal to those artists who show a desire to distance themselves from pure formal variations, to venture, on the contrary, to achieve a poetics that enhances critical signs, and that enables reading conditions that dialogue with reality.

  Mail art has a long tradition of political positioning and resistance.

  What can mail art and experimental poetry contribute today to the path of resistance? What are the media and discourses that are deployed to influence the convulsed world we inhabit? To what aspects of our reality is this resistance directed? For Deleuze to think is to resist, and thought is a set of forces that resists death. In our contemporary world, death has multiple faces: forced migrations, wars, poverty, hunger, climate change, inequality of the capitalist system, propagation and rise of far-right political forces. What can poetry do in the face of all this?"

  ## UTSANGA 10 años (2014-2024) Espacio liminar – Poesía visiva italiana contemporánea {id="utsanga"}

  Curaduría presentada por el poeta experimental y editor Francesco Aprile, en el marco de las actividades de celebración de los 10 años de existencia de la  revista electrónica de poesía experimental UTSANGA.

  Utsanga.it is an online magazine about liminal analysis. The term “utsanga” is a Sanskrit word that meaning “womb, embrace”. The magazine was founded by Francesco Aprile and Cristiano Caggiula in 2014 and can count on an international editorial team: Bartolomé Ferrando, Nico Vassilakis, Volodymyr Bilyk, Wellington Amancio Silva, Egidio Marullo.

  Immediately, Aprile and Caggiula have configured Utsanga not only as magazine, but as research and production center and archive about experimental poetry: visual, sound and concrete poetry, asemic writing, glitch art, video, performance, mail art, code poetry, electronic literature and so on.

  As archive, Utsanga has an important collection based on the visual and concrete poetry, and also on asemic writing and glitch art and writing. Some of the most important international authors in visual poetry and asemic writing from Seventies to today are part of the archive.

  As production center, Utsanga proposed the first asemic writing exhibition in Italy and many more exhibitions and conferences.

  **TOWARDS LIMINAL SPACES** (Francesco Aprile)

  The experimental poetic scenario opens as a guerilla war, or, more precisely, as anger, but towards what? The idea, in this case, seems to me to be extremely near certain dynamics developed by Deleuze and Guattari. The philosophy, then, would be regarding anger towards the historical context, towards one's own time. Philosophy is not power. However, power enters everyone's lives, despite themselves. It passes through subjects and philosophies. The nature of philosophy is to be a pourparler, to become a guerrilla war of the subject against himself and his time.

  The history of contemporary writing, from the experimental antecedents of the nineteenth century to the twentieth century, and up to the present day, is that in which we see the great era of writing retreat. In the media advance, combined with reformulating new paths, we are witnessing the triumph of the image and a return of orality (think of certain onomatopoeic and sound practices of Vielé-Griffin, Verlaine, Nodier, Gautier, or Rimbaud, up to the sound experiments of the Futurists, the Dadaists, the Lettrists, the Concrete and Visual poets) which is no longer primary but dispersed.

  The great machine of writing is retreating, leaving residue and fragments behind and in front of it. In its exclusive relationship with the signified, the imperialism of the signifier shows its cracks, to the advantage of asemic spaces and flows. These minimal spaces, which refuse interpretation, testify to the authoritarian character of the signifier and the signified. Writing becomes a physical operation. It allows a rediscovery of matter by coming into contact with other materials and other elements.

  The tyranny of the signifier/signified dyad appears in the image of Walter Benjamin's Angelus Novus: it is that figure who, in turning his back on the future, accumulates debris, fragments, and

  ruins behind him. In this epic of ruins, the concept of writing is reformulated as an accumulation of debris, bundled-up objects, and encroaching surfaces without anchorage, without a centre, an accumulation without assembly.

  We are no longer witnessing an assembly of materials, but a heaping of them, where the surfaces that encroach on each other refer to the interchangeability between ends and means, to the exchange of roles, and in the absence of anchoring points reveal faults, cracks, and elements that emerge and break the homogeneity of equality, showing presences, and therefore, singular and infinite existences, where infinity stands for the greatness of another meaning, external to the crisis, as well as for the absence of a unitary project. The ultimate one becomes, in the continuous postponements, a “Real,” in which the boundary between different surfaces becomes increasingly labile.

  This debris forms continuous references, and manifests itself in the form of a "conjunction." That is, it becomes creative babble. The language, in this way, is no longer used subject to its tyranny; but the author would make a "foreign" use of it. The future is that of foreign speakers who sketch out fragments of languages. Digital objects become objects of language, objects of fragments, fragments of objects, constant babble. This conjunction between debris becomes an opening to multiplicity, to diversity, to being foreign in oneself. They are “Writing” formulas open to proliferation. We are no longer witnessing tyrannical writing, but the triumph of writing that is still "toward total poetry," a constant process towards something multiple, within which different thresholds coexist. Writing and the author become liminal spaces.
